                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Ken Marco Manuel, a passionate web and mobile developer with a keen interest in IT. I'm
                    currently studying at NU-Dasma, where I'm dedicated to learning and growing in the field of
                    technology. I love exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. My
                    goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute to innovative projects that make a
                    difference.</p>

                <h2>Project: Number Counter</h2>
                <p>Number Counter is a simple interactive project that allows users to increment, decrement, or reset a displayed number using on-screen buttons. This project demonstrates the basics of event handling and dynamic content updating. It’s a great beginner project for understanding how user input can manipulate data in real-time and how changes are reflected in the user interface.

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Project: Moving Box</h2>
                <p>Moving Box is a basic interactive project that demonstrates user-controlled movement using keyboard inputs. The application features a box displayed on the screen that only moves when the arrow keys are pressed. Each arrow key moves the box in the corresponding direction—up, down, left, or right—providing a visual representation of real-time keyboard interaction. This project highlights fundamental concepts of event handling and DOM manipulation (or canvas movement, depending on your setup), making it a great learning tool for beginners in programming or web development.</p>

                <h2>Project: Weather App</h2>
                <p>Weather App is a user-friendly application that provides real-time weather updates for any city or location. By entering a city name, users can view current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. The app fetches data from a weather API and dynamically updates the interface with relevant weather information and icons. This project showcases API integration, asynchronous data fetching, and responsive UI design, making it a solid example of modern web or mobile development skills.</p>
